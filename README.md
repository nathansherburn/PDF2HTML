PDF2HTML
========

Based on the open source <a href="http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/">PDF to HTML converter</a> by Gueorgui Ovtcharov and Rainer Dorsch (which in turn was built upon Derek Noonburg's <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">xpdf</a> package), this repository is a web GUI for the PDF to HTML converter. 

The code can be run on any server with the PDF to HTML software installed.
