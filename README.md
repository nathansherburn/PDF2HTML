PDF2HTML
========

Based on the open source PDF to HTML converter by Gueorgui Ovtcharov and Rainer Dorsch - <a href="https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX">pdf2html</a> - (which in turn was built upon Derek Noonburg's <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">xpdf</a> package), this repository is a web implementated PDF to HTML converter. 

The code can be run on any server with the PDF to HTML software installed.
